# Package: iGEM Interlab Devices

A collection of the devices used in the 2018 iGEM Interlab (https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-020-01127-5). This could be expanded upon to include other devices from the iGEM Interlab activity should it be necessary. These are meant to be synthesized into pSB1C3 as originally designed without any new modficiations or additions in order to create accurate reference samples.
